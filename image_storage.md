# Image **Storage**
- should peers that belong to the decentralized image store be required to store data on IPFS?
    - to take advantage of content addressing
    - to allow for replication of data accross IPFS nodes?
- IPFS backend for image storage should be prioritized
- crawler subsystem should be migrated to the Image storage abstraction layer as soon as possible.
